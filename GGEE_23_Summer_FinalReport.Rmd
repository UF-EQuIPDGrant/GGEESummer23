# Summary

The Goldberg Gator Engineering Explorers (GGEE) Summer Program was designed to provide middle school students with an authentic experience in programming, engineering design, and computational thinking. The 2023 Summer Program successfully engaged 319 students across 8 school districts. Students developed computational thinking skills through design-based challenges using micro:bit micro-controllers. 

Schools and Districts partnered with the GGEE program to host programs and sponsor teachers and materials for the programs at their schools. There were 20 local teachers that lead summer programs in their area. Twenty undergraduate engineering students from the University of Florida and neighboring colleges and universities supported teacher leaders and served as mentors for students in the program. Both teachers and undergraduate mentors were trained in program activities to upskill their abilities in programming, computational thinking, engineering desgin, and teaching practices. Two grant staff coordinated and ran the programs.

Program costs per student 

**Last year summary**
*Students reported they felt challenged during the program but were rewarded when their code or design worked. They also mentioned the importance of collaboration with peers to solve engineering problems, and they enjoyed the mentorship of the college students working with the program. The longitudinal effects of the summer program on grades in math and science and students' enrollment in higher-level courses will be tracked by the research study for the program. All districts provided in-kind donations to the camp, and many school districts have plans to host or expand the programs for next year. Some schools have asked about follow-up programming, including afterschool programming to continue student engagement. The cost per student for the program was $996, including all costs for program development (three months), camp costs (two months), and post-assessment of the program. The cost per student for future camps should be less owing to development costs built into the program's first year.*


# Introduction

## Background
The Goldberg Gator Engineering Explorers Summer Program was initiated by a generous donor, Arnold Goldberg, to the University of Florida Foundation. He envisioned a free summer program for underrepresented minority middle school students. The program would allow students to experience computer science and have opportunities to learn to not only program but build skills in computational thinking, problem solving, and engineering design. The vision was brought to life by the EQuIPD grant at the University of Florida. Their team developed introductory and advanced-level summer programs and have worked with schools and districts to host the programs across the state of Florida. 

The Goldberg Gator Engineering Explorers Program was designed to introduce middle school-aged students to programming and computer science. The program begins with students learning the base elements of coding through small activities that engage them in applying concepts such as strings, conditional statements, loops, and variables. They use these concepts and the micro:bit to develop a simple game and to also collect and analyze light intensity data to study the relationship of light intensity and distance. The program then has students working on two scaling design challenges with partners and teams. The first is a creative engineering design challenge where they create a micro:bit pet for a partner. Then second is a technical design challenge where teams create a solution to a local problem - traffic lights for emergency service vehicles, environmental sensors for a farmer, and an indicator for new drivers. 

After the pilot program during the summer of 2022, 

Provide a brief overview of the middle school summer program, including its purpose and objectives. Highlight why the program was initiated and its importance in the district.

## Enrollment Statistics
*Present enrollment data, including the number of students who initially registered, and any changes over the course of the program.*

Programs were able to host up to 25 students in each of their program sessions. Registrations were closed and students were placed on wait lists in the case of cancellations by student parents. 
Programs had on average X number of students enroll. Wait lists ranged from 5 - 80 students in some districts.

## Attendance Records
*Share attendance records to illustrate the level of student engagement and participation throughout the program.*

Actual attendance with the programs were less than initial registrations. Students became ill, were unable to attend the first days of the program or parents made new plans for their families.

# Recommendations

## Suggestions for Program Improvement
*Provide recommendations for improving the program in future iterations, based on the insights gained.*

- Updating compliance forms with more clear langaue for parent and the research study
- Make submitting paperwork a part of the registration process. Did this with the 2023-2024 After-School programs and it has made everything so much easier to process and collect rather than a 2-step process
- Creating contract-like documents to denote needs, requirments, and expectations from the schools and what is provided from the GGEE program at UF
- Starting Recruitment in November
- ensuring districts cover technology to continue to use in after-school programs or integrate into classroom projects
- revise research study to expand to get more teacher and UF undergraduate mentor insight in the program
